handheld heroes player rev b.gb
===============================

This is a bonus ROM for the Handheld Heroes Volume One compilation. The 
compilation contains 40 tracks by as many artists, but the ROM only has
4 tracks by Maru303, nordloef, BSK and Saskrotch. It was released in 2012
and was the first release using nitro2k01's modded LSDj player version. This
player is based on the standard version of LSDj, but modified to read song data
from ROM instead of RAM. This makes it possible to run it on a cartridge
without external SRAM or a battery.

The whole compilation is still available for download on Bandcamp:
