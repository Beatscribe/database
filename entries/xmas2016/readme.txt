===============

The ASM Xmas Card is a musical season's greetings card on a cartridge. Released
in 2016, it was based on a modified version of Carillon in order to fit 4 songs
(not counting any easter eggs that may or may not exist) on a 32 kB cartridge.
The music on this cartridge was composed by chiptune wizard nordloef.

This free ROM does not include any of the easter eggs, which are exclusive to
the cartridge release.
